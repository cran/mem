\title{
Thresholds for influenza intensity
}
\description{
Function \code{memintensity} is used to calculate the thresholds for influenza activity 
using historical records (surveillance rates).\cr 
This method is based on the Moving Epidemics Method (MEM) used to monitor influenza 
activity in a weekly surveillance system.
}
\usage{
memintensity(i.data, i.levels = c(0.40,0.90,0.975), i.n.max = -1, i.seasons = 10)
}
\arguments{
  \item{i.data}{
Data frame of input data.
}
  \item{i.levels}{
Levels of the intensity thresholds.
}
  \item{i.n.max}{
Number of epidemic values used to calculate the intensity thresholds.
}
  \item{i.seasons}{
Maximum number of seasons to use.
}
}
\details{
Input data is a data frame containing rates that represent historical influenza surveillance 
data. It can start and end at any given week (tipically at week 40th), and rates can be 
expressed as per 100,000 inhabitants (or per consultations, if population is not 
available) or any other scale.\cr
MEM is used to locate the epidemic for each season. Then confidence intervals are 
calculated at different levels.\cr
The parameter \code{i.levels}, define the three levels of the confidence intervals 
used to calculate thresholds.\cr
The \code{i.n.max} parameter indicates how many epidemic values to use to calculate 
the thresholds. A value of -1 indicates the program to use an appropiate number of 
points depending on the number of seasons provided as input.\cr
The \code{i.seasons} parameter indicates how many seasons are used for calculating 
thresholds. A value of -1 indicates the program to use as many as possible. If there 
are less than this parameter, the program used all seasons avalaible.\cr
Intensity thresholds and Epidemic threshold defines 5 levels of intensity:\cr
\tabular{rlll}{
\tab \code{1} \tab Baseline level - Below epidemic threshold.\cr
\tab \code{2} \tab Low level - Above epidemic threshold and below low intensity 
                   threshold.\cr
\tab \code{3} \tab Medium level - Above low intensity threshold and below medium 
                   intensity threshold.\cr
\tab \code{4} \tab High level - Above medium intensity threshold and below high 
                   intensity threshold.\cr
\tab \code{5} \tab Very high level - Above high intensity threshold.\cr
}
}
\value{
\code{memintensity} returns a list with three objects, two of them are the parameters 
used (\code{param.levels} and \code{param.seasons}) and the third one 
(\code{intensity.thresholds}) is a matrix 1x4 with the epidemic and intensity thresholds.
\tabular{rlll}{
